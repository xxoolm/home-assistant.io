The **Suez Water** {% term integration %} fetches your water consumption data from the French water provider [Tout Sur Mon Eau](https://www.toutsurmoneau.fr) website.

## Sensors

- The **Water usage yesterday** sensor shows yesterday's water consumption data if that data is available.
- The **Water price** sensor shows the current water price in euros per cubic meter (â‚¬/m3).
