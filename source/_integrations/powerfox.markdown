The **Powerfox** {% term integration %} allows you to gather data from your [Poweropti](https://shop.powerfox.energy/collections/frontpage) devices, by using their cloud API and fetch the data in Home Assistant.

[Powerfox](https://www.powerfox.energy/) is a German company that provides smart meters (Poweropti) for reading electricity, water, gas, and heat. They have their own cloud platform where you can monitor the usage of your devices and get insights into your energy consumption.

- **Energy usage (kWh)**: How much energy is used since the installation.
- **Energy usage - low tariff (kWh)**: Energy usage on the low tariff.
- **Energy usage - high tariff (kWh)**: Energy usage on the high tariff.
- **Energy returned (kWh)**: Energy returned to the grid.

{% note %}
The energy tariff sensors are only available if your Poweropti device supports it.
{% endnote %}
