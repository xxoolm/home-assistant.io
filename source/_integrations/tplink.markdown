The `tplink` integration allows you to control your [TP-Link Kasa Smart Home Devices](https://www.tp-link.com/kasa-smart/) and [TP-Link Tapo Devices](https://www.tapo.com/) such as cameras, lights, plugs, wall switches, hubs, and hub-attached devices.

## How you can use this integration

The TP-Link integration lets you do many things, such as switching devices on and off based on schedules or events, monitoring energy usage in the Home Assistant dashboards, viewing live camera feeds, and controlling device configurations manually or via automations.

## Prerequisites

You need to provision your newly purchased device to connect to your network before it can be added via the integration. This can be done either by using [kasa command-line tool](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#provisioning) or by adding it to the official Kasa or Tapo app before trying to add them to Home Assistant. Some apps for TP-Link's other products, such as the Deco app, also allow you to add Kasa and Tapo devices. Since these devices use the same TP-Link Cloud Account for authorization, they work with this integration as well.

If your device is a newer Kasa or Tapo device it will require your TP-Link cloud username and password to authenticate for local access.
If you have an older device that does not currently require authentication, you may consider disabling automatic firmware updates to keep it that way.

## Supported functionality

### Cameras

Only Tapo cameras are currently supported.
In order for live view to work, you will need to enable your camera account in the Tapo App under **Device Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Camera Account**.
If you do not want to do this, keep **Live view** unchecked when adding the device. This can be changed at a later date using the `reconfigure` option on the integration entry.

Depending on the supported features of the camera, you can control various settings such as privacy mode, pan/tilt, and motion detection alerts.

### Lights

Light entities are added for bulbs, light strips, and dimmer switches. 
Depending on the supported features of the device, the integration will allow changing brightness, color, color temperature, and light effects.

If light effects are supported by a device, they can be selected from the bottom of the light card.
Light presets are also supported and can be set via the config preset drop down on the device page.

Depending on the supported features of the device you can control various other configuration settings such as on/off transitions and auto-on/off.

### Plugs and switches

Switch entities are added for plugs, simple wall switches and power strips. In addition to turning devices on and off, you can control the various configuration options that the device supports, such as auto-on/off and automatic firmware updates.

### Energy monitoring

If a device supports energy monitoring sensors will be created for consumption metrics which can be fed into the Home Assistant energy dashboard.

### Hub-attached devices

Various hub attached devices are supported such as those providing climate control, motion detection, humidity monitoring and water leak detection.


## Data updates

Devices are polled for data updates every 5 seconds. When you make changes through Home Assistant (e.g., switching a device on), the device's state is updated immediately rather than waiting for the next poll.
The integration connects locally to the devices without going via the TP-Link cloud. This is different from the native Tapo and Kasa apps which will connect to the devices via the TP-Link cloud if the device has access to the internet.

## Known limitations

### Camera connections

Some firmware versions of Tapo Cameras will not authenticate unless you enable **Tapo Lab** > **Third-Party Compatibility** in the native Tapo app.
Alternatively, you can factory reset and then prevent the device from accessing the internet.

### Subnets and discovery

If devices are on a different subnet to Home Assistant, automatic discovery will not work.
In this instance it is recommended to add devices by IP address and configure them with static IP addresses to prevent issues when IP addresses change.

### Buttons

The hub-attached Tapo buttons S200B and S200D, do not currently support alerting when the button is pressed.

### Hub-attached cameras

Hub attached cameras will be supported in the future. Due to battery considerations they do not support live view.

### No light effects on kasa bulbs

Light effects are currently not supported on Kasa bulbs.

### Kasa power strips

Due to limitations of the devices, the energy monitoring state of Kasa power strip child plugs is only updated every 60 seconds.

If required, you can manually trigger an update via **Developer tools** > **Actions** > **Home Assistant Core Integration: Update entity** passing a list of the child entities.

## Troubleshooting

### Device connections

- Take note of the known limitation for subnets above.
- Ensure that your username is your TP-Link cloud username, which is your *case-sensitive* email address.
- Ensure you have enabled **Tapo Lab** > **Third-Party Compatibility** in the Tapo app. You may need to factory reset and re-add to the Tapo app after this step.
- Disable or remove any custom integrations that interact with TPLink devices supported by this integration.
- Ensure stable network connectivity between Home Assistant and the device.
- Check the [reported connection solutions](#reported-connection-solutions) section below.
- Check the [supported device list](#supported-devices) to see if the device is tested to work with the integration. 
- Try running the [kasa tool](https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa) to connect to the device. An easy way to do this is to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and run `uvx --from python-kasa kasa --username <tplink cloud username> --password <tplink cloud password>`
- Raise a support issue.  See the [section below](#raising-support-issues) for guidelines.

#### Reported connection solutions

These are some of the solutions that Home Assistant users have reported as solving their device connection issues:

- Make the first letter of your TP-Link cloud username email upper-case. This could be because it was automatically capitalized when first entered into the Tapo app.
- Remove the device from the Tapo app and re-add by searching for the correct model (i.e. do not use auto-discovery)
- Log out of the Tapo and Kasa apps, factory reset the device, log back in to the Tapo app, then re-add the device to the Tapo app.
- Specifically for cameras, disable and re-enable the **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Camera account** options in the Tapo app.
- Specifically for cameras, reset the **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Camera account** credentials in the Tapo app.

### Unavailable entities

Some entities might be showing as Unavailable if they have been removed from the integration.

#### Total consumption sensor

This entity is only reported by older kasa devices.
Currently, Tapo devices and newer Kasa devices do not report total consumption, although briefly during 2024.6, they incorrectly reported today's consumption as "total consumption." You can safely delete this entity if it is reported as unavailable on a newer Kasa or Tapo device.

#### Update available sensor

This entity has been removed from the integration due to stability issues, calling the TPLink cloud API to check for updates. It will be replaced in a future release with a new Update entity, but if you have an Unavailable entity ID starting with `binary_sensor.` and ending with `update`, you can safely delete it.

### Raising support issues

For the maintainers of the TP-Link integration to be able to properly assist with a support issue, please follow these guidelines:

- Raise an issue with [Home Assistant Core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues).
- Fill in as many of the fields in the issue template as you can.
- If applicable, list all steps taken from the [Troubleshooting device connections](#device-connections) section above.
- Upload [debug logs](#enable-debug-logging) that run from Home Assistant first starting up, until the error is encountered.

### Enable debug logging

To capture debug logs from Home Assistant first starting up, update [`configuration.yaml`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) to look like this:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning  # This will already be present. Add the lines below.
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.tplink: debug
    kasa: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant, trigger the error, and download the logs from **Settings** > **System** > **Logs** > **Download logs**

{% note %}
Remember to disable debug logging after troubleshooting to prevent excessive log growth and performance impact.
{% endnote %}

## Examples

### Automation ideas 

- Turn on lights when it gets dark and turn them off again with a voice command.
- Turn off privacy mode and turn on motion detection for internal cameras when you leave home (with geofencing) and toggle back when you get home.

### Light effect services

There are two services for light effects that can be used in automations.

These are available on devices that support light effects such as bulbs and light strips, except for [kasa bulbs](#no-light-effects-on-kasa-bulbs)
