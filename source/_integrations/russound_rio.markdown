The Russound RIO {% term integration %} allows you to control Russound devices that make use of the RIO protocol.

The platform automatically discovers all enabled zones and sources. Each zone is added as a media player device with the enabled sources available as inputs. Media information is supported if the selected source reports it. The integration allows you to navigate presets, control volume of all zones, and play radio stations all from your Home Assistant dashboard.

- Russound MBX-PRE
- Russound MBX-AMP

## Troubleshooting

### There is a delay on getting the current status

Some older Russound devices have a slight delay before posting a new status to Home Assistant. 
This can be resolved by updating the unit to the latest firmware.
