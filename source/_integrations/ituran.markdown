The **Ituran** {% term integration %} allows you to retrieve information from your Ituran-equipped vehicle using the [Ituran APP service](https://www.ituran.co.il/ituranfront/comfort-services-2/ituran-app-comfort). It pulls information from the Ituran web service regarding the vehicle's location.

## Prerequisites

You must have an Ituran account for use with the Ituran APP ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ituran.forall)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1227756834)). All devices that work with the app, should work with this integration as well.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
ID or passport number:
  description: Your government ID or passport number used to sign-up with Ituran.
Mobile phone number:
  description: The mobile phone number used to sign-up with Ituran. A one-time-password will be sent to this number.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Data updates

The information is pulled every 5 minutes from the Ituran web service; however, the data is updated at intervals determined by Ituran based on whether the vehicle is stationary or not.

## Supported functionality

### Device tracker

The Ituran {% term integration %} will track the location of each vehicle registered to your account.

### Sensor

The Ituran {% term integration %} also exposes the following sensors for each registered vehicle:

- **Address** - The address that corresponds with the vehicle's location, as determined by Ituran
- **Battery voltage** - The measured voltage (V) of the car battery. If not supported by the installation, the value will be set to `-1`
- **Heading** - The direction (0-359Â°) that the vehicle is pointing to
- **Last update from vehicle** - The time from when the vehicle last published its information to the Ituran cloud
- **Mileage** - The distance (km) the vehicle has traveled
- **Speed** - The current speed (km/h) of the vehicle

## Known limitations

- While this integration is configured with your account, you won't be able to use the official app, as only one connection at a time is supported
  - As a workaround, it's possible to add another user from the app, with a different ID and mobile phone number that will be dedicated for Home Assistant use.
- The vehicle's heading value is unreliable when it's not in motion
- The mileage value is not read from the vehicle's odometer but is calculated from GPS, which may result in slight variations from the actual odometer reading

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
