{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Data updates

The **Bang & Olufsen** integration uses the [Mozart API](https://bang-olufsen.github.io/mozart-open-api), which is a local REST API with a WebSocket notification channel for immediate state information for media metadata, playback progress, volume etc. The only exception to this is the repeat and shuffle controls which are polled every 30 seconds.

## Supported features

Currently, a single device with a `media_player` entity is created for each added physical device. For advanced automations, [events](#automations) are fired in Home Assistant.

### Media player

A number of features are available through the media player entity:

- See current metadata, progress, volume, etc.
- Control next/previous, play/pause, shuffle/repeat settings, volume, sound mode, audio and video sources, and more.
- Play various media through [play_media actions](#play_media-actions).
- Control multiroom audio through [Beolink](https://support.bang-olufsen.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411572883089-What-is-Beolink-Multiroom):
  - Control with Home Assistant media_player grouping.
  - Monitor current [Beolink state](#beolink) through media player properties.
  - For more advanced usage, [custom Beolink services](#custom-actions) have been defined:
     - Connect or expand to [ASE](https://support.bang-olufsen.com/hc/en-us/articles/24766979863441-Which-platform-is-my-Connected-Audio-product-based-on) products not available in Home Assistant.
     - Expand sessions to all discovered devices.
     - Connect to, expand to or unexpand devices.
     - Set all connected Beolink devices to standby.

## Limitations

Currently, some features of the Mozart platform are not available through the [public API](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/mozart-open-api). Some may become available at a later point, but until then the [Bang & Olufsen App](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/dk/story/apps) can be used to configure these settings and features:

- Creating timers and alarms
- Retrieving detailed alarm and timer information

And more advanced app-centric features such as:

- Creating presets
- Creating listening positions
- Creating sound modes
- Creating stereo pairs
- Adjusting specific sound settings
- Pairing remotes

## Actions

Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS messages are limited to 100 unique messages a day and are cached for 24 hours.

Extra keys available:

| Data attribute            | Optional | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overlay_absolute_volume` | yes      | Specify an absolute volume for the overlay.                                                       |
| `overlay_offset_volume`   | yes      | Specify a volume offset to be added to the current volume level.                                  |
| `overlay_tts_language`    | yes      | Specify the language used for text-to-speech. Uses the BCP 47 standard. Default value is "en-us". |

###### Examples:

Playing a local file with an absolute volume as an overlay:

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: music
  media_content_id: media-source://media_source/local/doorbell.mp3
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_absolute_volume: 60
```

Playing a Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS message with an offset volume (as TTS messages can be quiet):

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: overlay_tts
  media_content_id: This is a test
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_offset_volume: 10
```

Playing a Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS message with a local language:

```yaml

```

### Custom actions

The Bang & Olufsen integration additionally supports different custom actions for Beolink.

[Beolink](https://support.bang-olufsen.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411572883089-What-is-Beolink-Multiroom) is Bang & Olufsen's advanced multiroom audio solution. This integration supports Home Assistant's `media_player` grouping, but to fully benefit from Beolink, such as being able to join legacy devices not added in Home Assistant, custom actions have been defined.

Attempting to execute an invalid Beolink action will result in either a Home Assistant error or an audible error indication from your device.

#### `bang_olufsen.beolink_join`

Join a Beolink experience.

| Action data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

##### Action usage example

```yaml
action: bang_olufsen.beolink_allstandby
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
```

## Automations

WebSocket notifications received from the device are fired as events in Home Assistant. These can be received by listening to `bang_olufsen_websocket_event` event types, where `device_id` or `serial_number` can be used to differentiate devices.

### Getting Deezer URIs

To find Deezer playlist, album URIs, and user IDs for Deezer flows, the Deezer website has to be accessed. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like: <https://www.deezer.com/en/album/ALBUM_ID>, and this needs to be converted to: `album:ALBUM_ID` and the same applies to playlists, which have the format: `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`.

Additionally a Deezer user ID can be found at <https://www.deezer.com/en/profile/USER_ID> by selecting the active user in a web browser.

### Getting Tidal URIs

Tidal playlists, album URIs and track IDs are available via the Tidal website. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like <https://listen.tidal.com/album/ALBUM_ID/>, and this needs to be converted to `album:ALBUM_ID`. The same applies to playlists, which have the format `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`. Individual tracks can be found by sharing the track and selecting the `Copy track link` method, which should yield a link of the format <https://tidal.com/browse/track/TRACK_ID?u>, this can be played by extracting the track id `TRACK_ID`.

### Beolink

Discovered devices and devices in an active Beolink experience are available in the properties of the media_player entity. A device is represented by its friendly name and JID, used for connecting devices.

```yaml
beolink:
  self: The current device
  leader: Beolink leader (if available)
  listeners: Beolink listeners (if available)
  peers: Beolink peers (if available)
```

## Diagnostics and troubleshooting

The **Bang & Olufsen** integration supports [Home Assistant debug logs and diagnostics](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics).
Where all received WebSocket events are provided through debug logs and the WebSocket connection state, config entry and media player state is provided through diagnostics.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
