00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:04.166
We all deserve a voice assistant

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.750
that doesnâ€™t harvest our data

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.316
and limit features.

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:08.516
That's why we're rapidly

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:10.466
advancing our open source,

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.583
privacy-focused voice

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:12.650
assistant for the home,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.150
and this led us to build high-quality

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.800
hardware to help more people

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.416
participate in its development

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:19.400
and to allow anyone

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
to preview the future of voice today.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.083
And our goal is ambitious

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:24.950
not just to match

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.416
existing voice assistants,

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:28.016
but to surpass them.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.416
We're already supporting languages

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.916
that big tech ignores,

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.066
all while running fully

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.766
local in your home.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.416
The era of open, private voice assistants

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:37.700
begins now.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.783
And we would love for you

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:39.700
to be a part of it.
