Home Assistant 2025.1! 🥂

Happy New Year! The whole Home Assistant project wishes you and your loved ones
a fantastic and healthy 2025! ❤️ Let's make this year even better than the last!

We are all super excited to kick off the new year with an absolute **massive**
release! 🎆

This release brings a complete overhaul of the backup system in Home Assistant,
which has been in the works for months! And I'm not just talking about some
user interface changes—no, we are talking about a complete overhaul from front
to back!

Automated backups, encrypted Home Assistant Cloud backup storage, retention
policies, configuration wizards, and even the ability for integrations to offer
backup storage locations! 🤯

But that is not all! We also had the [Month of “What the Heck?!”](/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/)
in December, which resulted in a lot of quality-of-life improvements raised
by the community that month!

There is so much to unwrap in this release, seriously, let's just dive in!

Enjoy the release!

## Overhaul of the backup system

Let’s talk about backups. Let’s be honest: they’re one of the most important yet
often overlooked tasks. But when disaster strikes, like a hardware failure,
having a reliable backup can save the day. Wouldn't you love to be back up and
running after disaster strikes?

While Home Assistant's previous backup system has proven to be solid
and reliable over the years, it didn't exactly make following best
practices—like regular backups, encryption, and off-site
storage—easy. Many of you had to rely on custom add-ons, automations,
or blueprints for backups to fill the gaps.

**That changes with this release! 🎉**

We've completely reworked the Home Assistant backup experience to help you set
up a solid backup strategy, using best practices in just a few clicks;
giving you peace of mind when it comes to your backups.

No worries, if you are using any custom solution for backups, they will continue
to work today. Even with everything new, we've made sure to keep everything
backward compatible.

So, without further ado, let's dive into the new backup system!

### Automated backups 🤖

Yes, you read that right—Home Assistant now supports automated backups!

Using a schedule, backups will be created on a regular basis without you having
to lift a finger. This ensures you always have a recent backup available,
without having to worry about it.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the bew backup overview page which shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-status.png" />

When you navigate to your backups in the settings menu, you will be
greeted with a new overview page that shows you exactly when your last backup
took place and when the next one is scheduled. Instant peace of mind!

Automated backups are taking place at 4:45 AM. So, while everyone in your home
is sleeping, Home Assistant makes sure your data is safe and sound. Backing up
at this early hour also means Home Assistant is done with its internal database
maintenance, ensuring your backup is as compact as possible.

If something ever goes wrong during the automated scheduled backup process,
Home Assistant will notify you through the repair center, ensuring you are
aware of it and can take action.

### Triggering an off-schedule automated backup 👆

Automated backups on a schedule are great, but sometimes, you might want to
trigger a backup **right now**! Maybe you are about to make big changes or
upgrade a whole bunch of things during an evening of tinkering.

No worries! You can now trigger an off-schedule automated backup from the backup
page at any time. This will immediately create a backup with the same
configuration as your scheduled automated backups.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup now button + dialog that allows you to trigger an off-schedule backup at any time" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-backup-now.png" />

The ability to trigger an on-demand automated backup is excellent, as it covers
all your backup settings in a single click. However, the ability to create
manual backups also still exists. This allows you to create a very specific
backup with the exact contents you want to have in it.

### Home Assistant Cloud backups 😎

Are you a [Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa] subscriber? Then you're in for a
treat! You can now automatically store your latest, fully encrypted, backup in
your Home Assistant Cloud account.

**This feature provides 5GB of storage at no extra cost, offering fully
encrypted off-site protection for your data! 🎁**

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Home Assistant Cloud is now a backup target location, that is included with the Home Assistant Cloud subscription at no additional costs" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-home-assistant-cloud.png" />

The backup can be downloaded from Home Assistant itself, but also from the
[Home Assistant Cloud account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/) @ Nabu Casa
in case you need it. This way, you can always access your latest backup, even
in case your Home Assistant hardware completely fails.

[Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa]: https://www.nabucasa.com/

### Backup locations are extendable by design 🧩

So, automated backups can be stored on your local disk and in Home Assistant
Cloud, but what if you want to store your backups somewhere else?

Choice is an important aspect of Home Assistant; we want to make everything as
flexible as possible without vendor lock-in. Therefore, the backup system
is designed to be **extendable**.

This means **integrations** can offer new storage locations—such as NAS devices,
Google Drive, Backblaze B2, or other storage providers—in the future.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an potential example storage provider provided by an integration" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-integration-location.png" />

Currently, this feature is brand new ✨, so **no** integrations offer additional
locations yet. However, we expect to see a few more integrations that provide
backup locations in the next release.

This extensibility ensures you can store your backups where you want them,
giving you the flexibility and choice to choose the storage solution you
prefer and trust.

### Encrypted backups by default 🔒

With the addition of Home Assistant Cloud as an off-site backup location, and
the potential for integrations to offer even more (off-site) backup locations,
security has become more important than ever. Your backups not only contain the
access credentials to your smart home devices but also the history of your home,
and no one should be able to access information that sensitive! **Ever!**

That is why all backups are now [AES-128] encrypted by default. To prioritize
your backups’ security we replaced the previous optional password
with a mandatory encryption key.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-encryption.png" />

When you set up your backups for the first time, an encryption key will be
generated for you. Make sure to store this key in a safe place, as you will need
it to restore your backups. To make this easier, you can download the key as
part of an emergency kit during setup—or anytime later from the backup settings
page. Keep it safe! 🔑

[AES-128]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

### Restoring backups available to all installation methods 🤗

More good news—restoring backups is now supported across
**all installation methods!** 🎉

Previously, only Home Assistant OS installations could restore backups. But
with this release, this feature is now available for all installation methods!
No matter how you run Home Assistant, even if you use our containers in a Docker
environment, you can now restore your Home Assistant backups.

This also means you can restore backups from local storage, Home Assistant
Cloud, or any future backup locations added through integrations.

As a matter of fact, all backup features, including everything we release today,
will be available regardless of the installation method you are using. We want
everyone to have a solid backup strategy.

### Backup retention 🗑

Our previous backup system made solid backups, which was good, but if you didn't
clean them up manually, eventually, you'd annoyingly run out of disk space. 😬

So! Backup retention is now a thing! You can now configure how many backups you
want to keep, and Home Assistant will handle the rest.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now configure a retention policy for your backups, allowing Home Assistant to clean it up automatically" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-retention.png" />

This cleanup will happen automatically after each backup. If you create a backup
manually for whatever reason, those will remain untouched, giving you full
control over special cases and workflows.

### Setting up backups for the first time 🚀

Getting started with the new backup system is quick and easy!

The first time you open the backup settings after upgrading, you will be greeted
by a **setup wizard** that will guide you through setting up your backups
step-by-step.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the our friendly wizard that will help you setting up your backups" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-wizard.png" />

The wizard will help you set up your encryption key, configure your backup
frequency, and set up your backup retention policy. And when it is ready, it
will immediately kick off your first backup!

All set! One less thing to worry about 🎉

### 3…2…1… Backups 🎊

We are super excited about this new backup system! As we enter the new year,
we encourage you to get serious about your backups.
A good New Year’s resolution, maybe? 😉

So, stop what you are doing right now and set up your backups! Go ahead and set
up that 3-2-1 backup strategy. Not sure what that is?

**You can read all about it in our [3…2…1… Backup blog post](/blog/2025/01/03/3-2-1-backup/).**

## Month of "What the Heck?!"

December’s **[Month of “What the Heck?!”](/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/)**
was an absolute blast! 🎉

A big thank you to everyone who contributed by sharing their “What the Heck?!”
moments and ideas for improving Home Assistant. Your input is incredibly
valuable and helps shape our roadmap and priorities moving forward.

Quite a bunch of shared "What the Heck?!" moments have been addressed in this
release already 🚀 —and we’re not stopping there! Expect to see even more
improvements inspired by your feedback in upcoming releases.

### Setting categories and labels when creating automations and scripts

For the first WTH item that has been resolved, we have [@jpbede] to thank!
And this one is also one of the higher-voted ones, so it is a good one! 
Andrew Jackson wrote:

[_**"WTH can you not add categories, labels etc when creating an automation"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-can-you-not-add-categories-labels-etc-when-creating-an-automation/802562)

Yeah, that is a good WTH! Whenever you create a new automation or script, you
probably want to organize it right away and not have to go back to the settings.
**FIXED**! 🎉

<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-category-labels-new-automation.png" />

When you create a new automation or script, and also when renaming it,
you can now set the description, category, labels, and areas right away!
🏷️ Nice!

### Quickly navigate to a device

You might be aware that you can bring up our quick navigation bar anywhere in
Home Assistant by pressing the `c` key on your keyboard to navigate various
places and the `e` key to search and navigate to any entity. However…

[_**"WTH is there no quick bar for devices?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-there-no-quick-bar-for-devices/802310)

Well, that is a good question that Andreas Brett raised! There is indeed no
such thing for devices. [@jpbede] to the rescue! You can now navigate to any
device using the quick bar by pressing the `d` key on your keyboard.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the quick bar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-quickbar-devices.png"/>

### Zoom & Pan for charts

KNXBroker raised the following WTH topic:

[_**"WTH lets upgrade History Graphs"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-lets-upgrade-history-graphs/802568)

You are right! The history graphs in Home Assistant are basic but functional!
Nevertheless, we can do better! 🚀

One of the bigger items in that WTH topic was the ability to zoom and pan...
Thanks to [@MindFreeze], you can now zoom and pan in any graph
in Home Assistant! 📈

<p class="img">
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scrolling your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-zoom-graphs.gif"/>
Zoom and drag any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl (or command on mac)
and scrolling your mouse wheel!
</p>

Hold the control key (or command on macOS) and scroll to zoom in and out using
your mouse. You can also click and drag to pan around the zoomed graph.

In addition to this change, [@MindFreeze] enabled small micro-animation for the
history graphs, making them look more alive and less static.

### Controlling the default exposure of new entities to Assist

mathd made the following point in a Month of "What the Heck?!" topic:

[_"WTH Are all new entities exposed to Assist by default?"_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-are-all-new-entities-exposed-to-assist-by-default/803889)

We hear you! Thanks to [@jpbede], you can now control the default exposure of
new entities to Assist. You can now toggle this on or off in the Home Assistant
Voice Assistant settings.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-default-expose-to-assist.png" />

### More "What the Heck?!" improvements

Many smaller improvements originate from the Month of “What the Heck?!” in this
release. Here are some of the other noteworthy ones:

[_**"WTH there is no hotkey for Assist"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-there-is-no-hotkey-for-assist/802403)**

Well, thanks to [@jpbede], you can now press the `a` key on your keyboard
anywhere in Home Assistant to summon Assist! 🎙️ Nice!

[_**"WTH doesn't HA ask if I want to save automations?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-doesnt-ha-ask-if-i-want-to-save-automations/804030)

Whoa! That is a good one! Thanks to [@jpbede], Home Assistant will now ask if
you want to save your automation before leaving the editor if there are unsaved
changes. 🤖

[_**"WTH Is in Energy Dashboard the individual devices not able to reorder"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-in-energy-dashboard-the-individual-devices-not-able-to-reorder/805051)

Thanks for that one yormedia! Honestly, this one has been raised in previous
editions of the Month of "What the Heck?!" a few times. Reason enough for
[@karwosts] to pick this up and make it happen! You can now reorder them in
the setting for categorization purposes. 🔡

[_**"WTH Can't I filter labels within a table filter?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-i-filter-labels-within-a-table-filter/802529)

Good question. If you have a lot of labels, scrolling through the list of labels
in the filter option can be a bit cumbersome. Thanks to [@silamon], you can
now search and filter through the labels in the filter option! 🔎

[_**WTH sentence trigger doesn't contain any context**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-sentence-trigger-doesnt-contain-any-context/802386)

Great idea! Thanks to [@balloob], the full conversation input is now available
to sentence triggers! 🗣️ This was actually the first WTH item to be resolved in
this edition! 😎

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Niko Home Control]**, done by [@VandeurenGlenn]

[@VandeurenGlenn]: https://github.com/VandeurenGlenn
[Niko Home Control]: /integrations/niko_home_control

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **DTE Energy Bridge** has been removed after being deprecated. The integration
  was no longer functional.
- **Simulated** has been previously deprecated and is now removed.
- **Stookalert** has been removed. The upstream data is no longer updated.
  The [Stookwijzer] integration is a good alternative to get the same information.

[Stookwijzer]: /integrations/stookwijzer

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:

- When viewing data tables and using `ctrl+f` in your browser to search, the
  search input will now be focused automatically. As native browser searches
  will not work on data tables. Thanks [@jpbede]!
- [@marcinbauer85] adjusted the "Add card" dialog, to automatically focus on the
  search field when you add a card, so you can start typing to search
  right away! Nice touch!
- Images uploaded through Home Assistant (for example, as background or as a
  user profile picture) are now browsable in the media browser.
  Thanks [@karwosts]!
- The unit of measurement is now shown next to the numeric slider in the
  more-info dialog of number entities. Thanks, [@abmantis]!
- Home Assistant now supports `mWh` as a unit of measurement for energy sensors
  and `mW` for electrical potential power sensors. Thanks [@agners]!
- [@wendevlin] added settings and category overflow actions to the automation
  and script editor (the three-dotted menu in the top right corner), making
  it easier to access those straight from the editor. Nice!
- The [logbook card] supports picking a target for things it should show
  events for. You can now pick based on entities, devices, areas,  floors,
  and labels! Thanks, [@silamon]!

## Dashboard background settings

A few releases ago, we made adding a background image to your dashboard easier.
This release, [@silamon] takes it a step further by adding a lot of settings
to customize how the background image is displayed.

This includes support for tiled backgrounds, transparency, size settings,
alignment, and allowing the background to scroll with the page or stay fixed.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now fully customize the background of your dashboard, with the options to changing tiling, transparency, alignment, and size seettings" src="/images/blog/2025-01/dashboards-background-settings.png" />

Nice! Thanks, [@silamon]!

[@silamon]: https://github.com/silamon

## Media player volume feature for Tile card

This is a super nice addition from [@simon-zumbrunnen]! The Tile card now
supports a media player volume slider feature. This feature allows you to
control the volume of a media player directly from the Tile card. 🔉
Nice work Simon!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "1-Wire" %}

The unit of measurement has been removed from 1-Wire counters because
`count` is not a unit 😁

([@jrieger] - [#132076]) ([documentation](/integrations/onewire))

[@jrieger]: https://github.com/jrieger
[#132076]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132076

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Denon HEOS" %}

Grouping a HEOS media player will now raise an exception if one of the members
is not a valid HEOS player. Previously unknown or invalid members would be
silently dropped.

([@andrewsayre] - [#132213]) ([documentation](/integrations/heos))

[@andrewsayre]: https://github.com/andrewsayre
[#132213]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132213

{% enddetails %}

{% details "devolo Home Control" %}

The integration with devolo Home Control has been updated to remove the option
to set the mydevolo URL. This option was used to integrate with the devolo
Home Control Cloud for development purposes only.
This option is no longer available.

([@Shutgun] - [#132821]) ([documentation](/integrations/devolo_home_control))

[@Shutgun]: https://github.com/Shutgun
[#132821]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132821

{% enddetails %}

{% details "FXCOM RFXtrx" %}

The unit of measurement has been removed from FXCOM RFXtrx counters because
`count` is not a unit 😁

([@jrieger] - [#133108]) ([documentation](/integrations/rfxtrx))

[@jrieger]: https://github.com/jrieger
[#133108]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/133108

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeWizard Energy" %}

The unit of measurement for the "Water usage" sensor has been updated from
`l/min` to `L/min`. This change standardizes the unit to improve consistency
across Home Assistant.

Any automations, scripts, or templates that rely on the old unit may need to be
adjusted. Long-term statistics will remain intact, but repair issues will be
created to ensure the data is updated with the new unit.

{% details "Tesla Fleet" %}

The included OAuth application credentials have been removed, as Tesla no longer
supports Open Source application registrations and is moving to a pay-per-use
model.

{% details "UniFi Network" %}

The states of "Device State" sensors have been standardized to match
Home Assistant core rules and be translatable. This affects the following
UniFi sensor states:

- `Connected`, which now became `connected`
- `Pending`, which now became `pending`
- `Firmware Mismatch`, which now became `firmware_mismatch`
- `Upgrading`, which now became `upgrading`
- `Provisioning`, which now became `provisioning`
- `Heartbeat Missed`, which now became `heartbeat_missed`
- `Adopting`, which now became `adopting`
- `Deleting`, which now became `deleting`
- `Inform Error`, which now became `inform_error`
- `Adoption Failed`, which now became `adoption_failed`
- `Isolated`, which now became `isolated`
- `Unknown`, which now became `unknown`

If you used those states directly in your automations, scripts, or templates;
you will need to adjust those to match these changes.

{% details "Zabbix" %}

The integration now uses the official Zabbix Python API. Because of this, the
minimum supported Zabbix version is now 5.0. This change drops support for
Zabbix 4 and before.
